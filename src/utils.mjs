/**
 * Makes comparison case insensitive. For example :
 * MaRRakesh
 * ↓
 * Marrakesh
 * Will be marked all green. So how do we go about doing this ?
 * There are 3 different classes availabe post-comparison :
 * <span class="typeGood"></span>   - green, means the this part matches the correct answer letter for letter.
 * <span class="typeBad"></span>    - red, means you've typed it wrong, typed 'a' when it should be 'c'.
 * <span class="typeMissed"></span> - gray, means you forgot a letter.
 *
 * In previous versions, I used to use my own algo for comparison, but as it started to get more complex, I decided to use a library for it. Now I use the diffChars() function from the jsdiff library, which uses state of the art algorithms to compare strings. It returns an array of objects, each object has a value and a boolean property called added or removed. If added is true, then the value is an addition, if removed is true, then the value is a deletion. If both are false, then it's a common part.
